<h1 id="territorial-acknowledgement">Territorial Acknowledgement</h1>

<p>I am speaking to you today from the city of Vancouver on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples.  Specifically the xÊ·mÉ™Î¸kÊ·É™yÌ“É™m (Musqueam), É™lÌ“ilwÉ™taÉÉ¬ (Tsleil-Waututh), and SkwxwÃº7mesh-ulh (Squamish) Nations.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-a-land-acknowledgement">Why Do a Land Acknowledgement?</h2>

<p>For centuries, settler societies have perpetuated a genocide against Indigenous people across the globe.  In many ways this genocide is still ongoing here in British Columbia and across Canada.  There has been concerted effort by the government, <strong>police</strong>, religious organizations, and educational institutions to erase Indigenous cultures and identity from both the land and the map.  A land acknowledgement is one small way to help with that.  It isnâ€™t just a formality.  It is a time to reflect and build understanding.  The maps and information presented below are sourced from <a href="https://native-land.ca/">native-land.ca</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-it-mean">What Does it Mean?</h2>

<p>Why do we say <em>traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory</em>?</p>

<p><strong>Traditional</strong>: recognizes that the lands were traditionally used and/or occupied.  The <a href="https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/x%ca%b7m%c9%99%ce%b8k%ca%b7%c9%99y%cc%93%c9%99m/">xÊ·mÉ™Î¸kÊ·É™yÌ“É™m</a>, and <a href="https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/tsleil-waututh-s%c9%99l%cc%93ilw%c9%99ta%c9%82%c9%ac/">É™lÌ“ilwÉ™taÉÉ¬</a>, <a href="https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/skwxwu7mesh-uxwumixw/">SkwxwÃº7mesh-ulh</a>Nations have traditionally occupied this area.</p>

<p><strong>Ancestral</strong>: recognizes land that is handed down from generation to generation.  It is meant to convey a deep rooted connection to the land.  Language has strong connections to ancestry.  The xÊ·mÉ™Î¸kÊ·É™yÌ“É™m and É™lÌ“ilwÉ™taÉÉ¬ speak dialects of <a href="https://native-land.ca/maps/languages/hulquminum-halqemeylem-h%c9%99n%cc%93q%cc%93%c9%99min%cc%93%c9%99m%cc%93/">Hulâ€™qâ€™umiâ€™numâ€™ / Halqâ€™emÃ©ylem / hÉ™nÌ“qÌ“É™minÌ“É™mÌ“</a> and the SkwxwÃº7mesh-ulh speak <a href="https://native-land.ca/maps/languages/s%e1%b8%b5wx%cc%b1wu7mesh-snichim/">Sá¸µwxÌ±wÃº7mesh snÃ­chim</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Unceded</strong>: refers to land that was not turned over to the Crown (government) by a treaty or other agreement.  Over 95% of the land in BC was never ceded by treaty.</p>

<h1 id="why-police-involved-deaths-in-canada">Why Police-Involved Deaths in Canada?</h1>

<p>Racism is ingrained in the history of policing in Canada since the founding of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in 1873.  Police in Canada play a central tool in Canadaâ€™s ongoing genocide of Indigenous people, actively work to oppress BIPOC communities, and do the bidding of those in power.</p>

<p>Canadian institutions rely on the lack of race based statistics and other demographic information to perpetuate a narrative that systemic racism is â€œjust an American issueâ€ and that Canada is â€œbetterâ€.  As a white settler and immigrant from the United States, I fell for that narrative and did not question it for years.</p>
<ul>
  <li>We need to have discussions about systemic racism in Canada and make it part of the public discourse in order to hold Canadian institutions accountable.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-am-i-doing-this-work">Why am I Doing this Work?</h2>

<p>I am a climate scientist and GIS instructor.  Iâ€™ve complied this data in my spare time, because it is an important issue that does not get the attention it deserves.</p>

<h1 id="key-points">Key Points</h1>

<p>1) Tracking Police Killings and Police Involved Deaths in Canada</p>

<p>2) What data is available and whatâ€™s lacking?</p>

<p>3) Next steps: Filling gaps and disseminating the information.</p>

<h1 id="notes-on-terminology">Notes on Terminology</h1>

<p><strong>Police Killing:</strong> A death directly resulting from police use of force.  Including but not limited to: shooting, tazing, other use of force.</p>

<p><strong>Police-Involved Deaths</strong>  Any civilian death at the hands of police or in the custody of police.  Includes police killings deaths resulting from police negligence/inaction: suicide, overdoses, medical emergencies, etc.  This is broader term that is more difficult to refute on the grounds of semantics.</p>
